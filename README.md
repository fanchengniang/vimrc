#My vim configure

####introduction
.vimrc is my own vim file. I'd like a light-weight and efficient editor. In my vim configure, I haven't installed many plugins.
> taglist.vim: jumping through C projects
> nerd/tree: browse file system
> supertab: word completion
> vim-airline: switching between opening files

Besides this, I'd like to used 4 space instead of tab and limit my code within 80 chars per line.

####usage
I have bind some key to simplify some command:
> F3: switch to the previous file
> F4: switch to the next file
> F8: open nerdtree
> F9: open taglist

**Hope you enjoy it!**
